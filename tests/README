This directory contains a testsuite for the Free Pascal Compiler.

Tests starting with 'ts' have to compile and execute.
Tests starting with 'tf' will throw an error when compiling.

You can use the batch files to do all tests. testall.bat will compile all
tests.

template1.bat is a template for compiling tests that have to run and
execute.

template2.bat is a template for compiling tests that should crash the
compiler. The test is considered passed if the compiler reports
an error (crashes aren't allowed).
