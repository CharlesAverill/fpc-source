First you need to install all the sources like:

<basedir>/
  compiler
  rtl
  ide/text
  ide/fake
  api
  fv
  gdbint
  gdbint/libgdb

- Copy the files (Makefile,makefile.fpc) from the base repository to the
<basedir>. 

- get the libgdb_<system>.zip from tflily ftp and unzip it in the
gdbint/libgdb directory

- Type: SET FPCDIR=<basedir>

- Then you can type 'make info' and see it finds the correct files.

- When that works fine, then you can type in the <basedir>: 'make ide_all'
