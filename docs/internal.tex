% About this document
\section{About this document}

This document tries to make the internal working of \fpc more clear.
It is assumed that the reader has some knowledge about compiler
building

This document describes the compiler as it is/functions at the time of
writing. Since the compiler is under continuous development, some of the
things described here may be outdated. In case of doubt, consult the
\file{README} files, distributed with the compiler.
The \file{README} files are, in case of conflict with this manual,
 authoritative.

I hope, my poor english is quite understandable. Feel free to correct
spelling mistakes.
