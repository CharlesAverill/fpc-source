 \section{General compiler messages}
 This section gives the compiler messages which are not fatal, but which
 display useful information. The number of such messages can be 
 controlled with the various verbosity level \var{-v} switches.
 \begin{description}
\item [Compiler: arg1]
 When the \var{-vu} switch is used, this line tells you what compiler 
 is used.
\item [Source OS: arg1]
 When the \var{-vd} switch is used, this line tells you what the source 
 operating system is.
\item [Info: Target OS: arg1]
 When the \var{-vd} switch is used, this line tells you what the target
 operating system is.
\item [Using executable path: arg1]
 When the \var{-vu} switch is used, this line tells you where the compiler
 looks for it's binaries.
\item [Using unit path: arg1]
 When the \var{-vu} switch is used, this line tells you where the compiler
 looks for compiled units. You can set this path with the \var{-Fu} or 
 \var{-Up} options.
\item [Using include path: arg1]
 When the \var{-vu} switch is used, this line tells you where the compiler
 looks for it's include files (files used in \var{\{\$I xxx\}} statements).
 You can set this path with the \var{-I} option.
\item [Using library path: arg1]
 When the \var{-vu} switch is used, this line tells you where the compiler
 looks for the libraries. You can set this path with the \var{-Fl} option.
\item [Using object path: arg1]
 When the \var{-vu} switch is used, this line tells you where the compiler
 looks for object files you link in (files used in \var{\{\$L xxx\}} statements). 
 You can set this path with the \var{-Fo} option.
\item [Info: arg1 Lines compiled, arg2 sec]
 When the \var{-vi} switch is used, the compiler reports the number
 of lines compiled, and the time it took to compile them (real time,
 not program time).
\item [Fatal: No memory left]
 The compiler doesn't have enough memory to compile your program. There are
 several remedies for this:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item If you're using the build option of the compiler, try compiling the
 different units manually.
 \item If you're compiling a huge program, split it up in units, and compile
 these separately.
 \item If the previous two don't work, recompile the compiler with a bigger
 heap (you can use the \var{-Ch} option for this, \seeo{Ch})
 \end{itemize} 
 \end{description}
 \section{Scanner messages.}
 This section lists the messages that the scanner emits. The scanner takes
 care of the lexical structure of the pascal file, i.e. it tries to find 
 reserved words, strings, etc. It also takes care of directives and
 conditional compiling handling.
 \begin{description}
\item [Fatal: Unexpected end of file]
 this typically happens in on of the following cases :
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The source file ends befor then final \var{end.} statement. This
 happens mostly when the \var{begin} and \var{end} statements aren't
 balanced;
 \item An include file ends in the middle of a statement.
 \item A comment wasn't closed.
 \end{itemize}
\item [Fatal: String exceeds line]
 You forgot probably to include the closing ' in a string, so it occupies
 multiple lines. 
\item [Fatal: illegal character]
 An illegal character was encountered in the input file. 
\item [Fatal: Syntax error arg1 expected]
 This indicates that the compiler expected a different token than 
 the one you typed. It can occur almost everywhere where you make a 
 mistake against the pascal language.
\item [Start reading includefile arg1]
 When you provide the \var{-vu} switch, the compiler tells you 
 when it starts reading an included file.
\item [Warning: Comment level arg1 found]
 When the \var{-vw} switch is used, then the compiler warns you if
 it finds nested comments. Nested comments are not allowed in Turbo Pascal
 and can be a possible source of errors.
\item [Note: argF directive (FAR) ignored]
 The \var{FAR} directive is a 16-bit construction which is recorgnised
 but ignored by the compiler, since it produces 32 bit code.
\item [Note: Stack check is global under linux]
 Stack checking with the \var{-Cs} switch is ignored under \linux, since
 \linux does this for you. Only displayed when \var{-vn} is used.
\item [Note: Ignored compiler switch arg1]
 With \var{-vn} on, the compiler warns if it ignores a switch
\item [Warning: Illegal compiler switch arg1]
 You included a compiler switch (i.e. \var{\{\$... \}}) which the compiler
 doesn't know.
\item [Warning: This compiler switch has a global effect]
 When \var{-vw} is used, the compiler warns if a switch is global.
\item [Error: Illegal char constant]
 This happens when you specify a character with its ASCII code, as in
 \var{\#96}, but the number is either illegal, or out of range. The range
 is 1-255.
\item [Fatal: Can't open file arg1]
 \fpc cannot find the program or unit source file you specified on the
 command line.
\item [Fatal: Can't open include file arg1]
 \fpc cannot find the source file you specified in a \var{\{\$include \}}
 stateent.
\item [Error: Too many argENDIFs or argELSEs]
 Your \var{\{\$IFDEF ..\}} and {\{\$ENDIF\}} statements aren't balanced.
\item [Warning: Records fields can be aligned to 1,2,4 or 16 bytes only]
 You are specifying the \var{\{\$PACKRECORDS n\} } with an illegal value for
 \var{n}. Only 1,2,4 or 16 are valid in this case.
\item [Warning: Enumerated can be saved in 1,2 or 4 bytes only]
 You are specifying the \var{\{\$PACKENUM n\}} with an illegal value for
 \var{n}. Only 1,2 or 4 are valid in this case.
\item [Error: arg1 expected for arg2 defined in line arg3]
 Your conditional compilation statements are unbalanced.
\item [Error: Syntax error while parsing a conditional compiling expression]
 There is an error in the expression following the \var{\{\$if \}} compiler
 directive.
\item [Error: Evaluating a conditional compiling expression]
 There is an error in the expression following the \var{\{\$if \}} compiler
 directive.
\item [Warning: Macro contents is cut after char 255 to evalute expression]
 The contents of macros canno be longer than 255 characters. This is a
 safety in the compiler, to prevent buffer overflows. This is shown as a 
 wraning, i.e. when the \var{-vw} switch is used.
\item [Error: ENDIF without IF(N)DEF]
 Your \var{\{\$IFDEF ..\}} and {\{\$ENDIF\}} statements aren't balanced.
\item [Fatal: User defined: arg1]
 A user defined fatal error occurred. see also the \progref
\item [Error: User defined: arg1]
 A user defined error occurred. see also the \progref
\item [Warning: User defined: arg1]
 A user defined warning occurred. see also the \progref
\item [Note: User defined: arg1]
 A user defined note was encountered. see also the \progref
\item [Hint: User defined: arg1]
 A user defined hint was encountered. see also the \progref
\item [Info: User defined: arg1]
 User defined information was encountered. see also the \progref
\item [Error: Keyword redefined as macro has no effect]
 You cannot redefine keywords with macros.
\item [Fatal: Macro buffer overflow while reading or expanding a macro]
 Your macro or it's result  was too long for the compiler.
\item [Warning: Extension of macros exceeds a deep of 16.]
 When expanding a macro macros have been nested to a level of 16.
 The compiler will expand no further, since this may be a sign that 
 recursion is used.
\item [Error: compiler switches aren't allowed in (* ... *) styled comments]
 Compiler switches should always be between \var{\{ \}} comment delimiters. 
\item [Handling switch "arg1"]
 When you set debugging info on (\var{-vd}) the compiler tells you when it
 is evaluating conditional compile statements.
\item [ENDIF arg1 found]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements.
\item [IFDEF arg1 found, arg2]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements.
\item [IFOPT arg1 found, arg2]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements.
\item [IF arg1 found, arg2]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements.
\item [IFNDEF arg1 found, arg2]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements.
\item [ELSE arg1 found, arg2]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements.
\item [Skipping until...]
 When you turn on conditional messages(\var{-vc}), the compiler tells you 
 where it encounters conditional statements, and whether it is skipping or
 compiling parts.
\item [Info: Press <return> to continue]
 When the \var{-vi} switch is used, the compiler stops compilation
 and waits for the \var{Enter} key to be pressed when it encounters
 a \var{\{\$STOP\}} directive.
\item [Warning: Unsupported switch arg1]
 When warings are turned on (\var{-vw}) the compiler warns you about
 unsupported switches. This means that the switch is used in Delphi or
 Turbo Pascal, but not in \fpc
\item [Warning: Illegal compiler directive arg1]
 When warings are turned on (\var{-vw}) the compiler warns you about
 unrecognised switches. For a list of recognised switches, \progref
\item [Back in arg1]
 When debugging messages are on (\var{-vd}) the compiler tells you when
 it has finished reading an include file.
\item [Warning: Unsupported assembler style specified arg1]
 When you specify an assembler mode with the \var{\{\$ASMMODE xxx\}}
 the compiler didn't recognize the mode you specified. 
 \end{description}
 \section{Parser messages}
 This section lists all parser messages. The parser takes care of the
 semantics of you language, i.e. it determines if your pascal constructs
 are correct.
 \begin{description}
\item [Error: Parser - Syntax Error]
 An error against the Turbo Pascal language was encountered. This happens
 typically when an illegal character is found in the sources file.
\item [Warning: Procedure type FAR ignored]
 This is a warning. \var{FAR} is a construct for 8 or 16 bit programs. Since
 the compile generates 32 bit programs, it ignores this directive.
\item [Warning: Procedure type NEAR ignored]
 This is a warning. \var{NEAR} is a construct for 8 or 16 bit programs. Since
 the compile generates 32 bit programs, it ignores this directive.
\item [Error: No DLL File specified]
 No longer in use.
\item [Error: Constructor name must be INIT]
 You are declaring a constructor with a name which isn't \var{init}, and the
 \var{-Ss} switch is in effect. See the \var{-Ss} switch (\seeo{Ss}). 
\item [Error: Destructor name must be DONE]
 You are declaring a constructor with a name which isn't \var{done}, and the
 \var{-Ss} switch is in effect. See the \var{-Ss} switch (\seeo{Ss}). 
\item [Error: Illegal open parameter]
 You are trying to use the wrong type for an open parameter.
\item [Error: Procedure type INLINE not supported]
 You tried to compile a program with C++ style inlining, and forgot to
 specify the \var{-Si} option (\seeo{Si}). The compiler doesn't support C++
 styled inlining by default. 
\item [Warning: Private methods shouldn't be VIRTUAL]
 You declared a method in the private part of a object (class) as
 \var{virtual}. This is not allowed. Private methods cannot be overridden
 anyway.
\item [Warning: Constructor should be public]
 Constructors must be in the 'public' part of an object (class) declaration. 
\item [Warning: Destructor should be public]
 Destructors must be in the 'public' part of an object (class) declaration. 
\item [Note: Class should have one destructor only]
 You can declare only one destructor for a class.
\item [Error: Local class definitions are not allowed]
 Classes must be defined globally. They cannot be defined inside a
 procedure or function
\item [Error: Anonym class definitions are not allowed]
 An invalid object (class) declaration was encountered, i.e. an 
 object or class without methods that isn't derived from another object or
 class. For example:
 \begin{verbatim}
 Type o = object
          a : longint;
          end;
 \end{verbatim}
 will trigger this error.
\item [Error: Illegal parameter list]
 You are calling a function with parameters that are of a different type than
 the declared parameters of the function.
\item [Error: Wrong parameter type specified]
 There is an error in the parameter list of the function or procedure.
 The compiler cannot determine the error more accurate than this.
\item [Error: Wrong amount of parameters specified]
 There is an error in the parameter list of the function or procedure,
 the number of parameters is not correct.
\item [Error: overloaded identifier isn't a function identifier]
 The compiler encountered a symbol with the same name as an overloaded
 function, but it isn't a function it can overload.
\item [Error: overloaded functions have the same parameter list]
 You're declaring overloaded functions, but with the same parameter list.
 Overloaded function must have at least 1 different parameter in their
 declaration.
\item [Error: function header doesn't match the forward declaration arg1]
 You declared the function in the \var{interface} part, or with the
 \var{forward} directive, but define it with a different parameter list. 
\item [Note: only values can be jumped over in enumeration types]
 \fpc allows enumeration constructions as in C. Given the following
 declaration two declarations:
 \begin{verbatim}
 type a = (A_A,A_B,A_E=:6,A_UAS:=200);
 type a = (A_A,A_B,A_E=:6,A_UAS:=4);
 \end{verbatim}
 The second declaration would produce an error. \var{A\_UAS} needs to have a
 value higher than \var{A\_E}, i.e. at least 7.
\item [Note: Interface and implementation names are different !]
 This note warns you if the implementation and interface names of a 
 functions are different, but they have the same mangled name. This
 is important when using overloaded functions. 
\item [Error: function nesting > 31]
 You can nest function definitions only 31 times. 
\item [Error: range check error while evaluating constants]
 The constants are out of their allowed range.
\item [Error: duplicate case label]
 You are specifying the same label 2 times in a \var{case} statement.
\item [Error: typed constants of classes are not allowed]
 You cannot declare a constant of type class or object.
\item [Error: functions variables of overloaded functions are not allowed]
 You are trying to assign an overloaded function to a procedural variable.
 This isn't allowed.
\item [Error: string length must be a value from 1 to 255]
 The length of a string in Pascal is limited to 255 characters. You are
 trying to declare a string with length greater than 255.
 (This is not true for \var{Longstrings} and \var{AnsiStrings}.
\item [Warning: use extended syntax of DISPOSE and NEW to generate instances of objects]
 If you have a pointer \var{a} to a class type, then the statement
 \var{new(a)} will not initialize the class (i.e. the constructor isn't
 called), although space will be allocated. you should issue the
 \var{new(a,init)} statement. This will allocate space, and call the
 constructor of the class.
\item [Error: class identifier expected]
 This happens when the compiler scans a procedure declaration that contains 
 a dot, 
 i.e., a object or class method, but the type in front of the dot is not
 a known type.
\item [Error: method identifier expected]
 This identifier is not a method.
 This happens when the compiler scans a procedure declaration that contains 
 a dot, i.e., a object or class method, but the procedure name is not a
 procedure of this type.
\item [Error: function header doesn't match any method of this class]
 This identifier is not a method.
 This happens when the compiler scans a procedure declaration that contains 
 a dot, i.e., a object or class method, but the procedure name is not a
 procedure of this type.
\item [procedure/function arg1]
 When using the \var{-vp} switch, the compiler tells you when it starts
 processing a procedure or function implementation.
\item [Error: Illegal floating point constant]
 The compiler expects a floating point expression, and gets something else.
\item [Error: FAIL can be used in constructors only]
 You are using the \var{FAIL} instruction outside a constructor method.
\item [Error: Destructors can't have parameters]
 You are declaring a destructor with a parameter list. Destructor methods
 cannot have parameters.
\item [Error: Only class methods can be referred with class references]
 This error occurs in a situation like the following:
 \begin{verbatim}
 Type :
    Tclass = Class of Tobject;
 
 Var C : TClass;
 
 begin
 ...
 C.free
 \end{verbatim}
 \var{Free} is not a class method and hence cannot be called with a class
 reference.
\item [Error: Only class methods can be accessed in class methods]
 This is related to the previous error. You cannot call a method of an object
 from a inside a class method. The following code would produce this error:
 \begin{verbatim}
 class procedure tobject.x;
 
 begin
   free
 \end{verbatim}
 Because free is a normal method of a class it cannot be called from a class
 method.
\item [Error: Constant and CASE types do not match]
 One of the labels is not of the same type as the case variable.
\item [Error: The symbol can't be exported from a library]
 You can only export procedures and functions when you write a library. You
 cannot export variables or constants.
\item [Warning: A inherited method is hidden by arg1]
 A method that is declared \var{virtual} in a parent class, should be
 overridden in the descendent class with the \var{override} directive. If you
 don't specify the \var{override} directive, you will hide the parent method;
 you will not override it.
\item [Error: There is no method in an ancestor class to be overridden: arg1]
 You try to \var{override} a virtual method of a parent class that doesn't
 exist.
\item [Error: No member is provided to access property]
 You specified no \var{read} directive for a property. 
\item [Error: Illegal symbol for property access]
 There is an error in the \var{read} or \var{write} directives for an array 
 property. When you declare an array property, you can only access it with 
 procedures and functions. The following code woud cause such an error.
 \begin{verbatim}
 tmyobject = class
   i : integer;
   property x [i : integer]: integer read I write i;
 \end{verbatim}
  
\item [Error: Cannot access a protected field of an object here]
 Fields that are declared in a \var{protected} section of an object or class
 declaration cannot be accessed outside the module wher the object is
 defined, or outside descendent object methods.
\item [Error: Cannot access a private field of an object here]
 Fields that are declared in a \var{private} section of an object or class
 declaration cannot be accessed outside the module where the class is
 defined.
\item [Warning: overloaded of virtual method must be virtual: arg1]
 If you declare overloaded methods in a class, then they should either all be
 virtual, or none. You cannot mix them.
\item [Error: overloaded methods which are virtual must have the same return type: arg1]
 If you declare virtual overloaded methods in a class definition, they must
 have the same return type.
\item [Error: EXPORT declared functions can't be nested]
 You cannot declare a function or procedure within a function or procedure
 that was declared as an export procedure.
\item [Error: methods can't be EXPORTed]
 You cannot declare a procedure that is a method for an object as
 \var{export}ed. That is, your methods cannot be called from a C program.
\item [Error: call by var parameters have to match exactly]
 When calling a function declared with \var{var} parameters, the variables in
 the function call must be of exactly the same type. There is no automatic
 type conversion. 
\item [Error: Class isn't a parent class of the current class]
 When calling inherited methods, you are trying to call a method of a strange
 class. You can only call an inherited method of a parent class.
\item [Error: SELF is only allowed in methods]
 You are trying to use the \var{self} parameter outside an object's method.
 Only methods get passed the \var{self} parameters.
\item [Error: methods can be only in other methods called direct with type identifier of the class]
 A construction like \var{sometype.somemethod} is only allowed in a method.
\item [Error: Illegal use of ':']
 You are using the format \var{:} (colon) 2 times on an expression that 
 is not a real expression. 
\item [Error: range check error in set constructor or duplicate set element]
 The declaration of a set contains an error. Either one of the elements is
 outside the range of the set type, either two of the elements are in fact
 the same.
\item [Error: Pointer to object expected]
 You specified an illegal type in a \var{New} statement. 
 The extended synax of \var{New} needs an  object as a parameter.
\item [Error: Expression must be constructor call]
 When using the extended syntax of \var{new}, you must specify the constructor
 method of the object you are trying to create. The procedure you specified
 is not a constructor.
\item [Error: Expression must be destructor call]
 When using the extended syntax of \var{dispose}, you must specify the
 destructor method of the object you are trying to dispose of. 
 The procedure you specified is not a destructor.
\item [Error: Illegal order of record elements]
 When declaring a constant record, you specified the fields in the wrong
 order.
\item [Error: Expression type must be class or record type]
 A \var{with} statement needs an argument that is of the type \var{record} 
 or \var{class}. You are using \var{with} on an expression that is not of 
 this type.
\item [Error: Functions with void return value can't return any value]
 In \fpc, you can specify a return value for a function when using 
 the \var{exit} statement. This error occurs when you try to do this with a
 procedure. Procedures  cannot return a value.
\item [Error: constructors and destructors must be methods]
 You're declaring a procedure as destructor or constructor, when the
 procedure isn't a class method.
\item [Error: Operator is not overloaded]
 You're trying to use an overloaded operator when it isn't overloaded for
 this type.
\item [Error: Re-raise isn't possible there]
 You are trying to raise an exception where it isn't allowed. You can only
 raise exceptions in an \var{except} block.
\item [Error: The extended syntax of new or dispose isn't allowed for a class]
 You cannot generate an instance of a class with the extended syntax of 
 \var{new}. The constructor must be used for that. For the same reason, you
 cannot call \var{Dispose} to de-allocate an instance of a class, the
 destructor must be used for that.
\item [Error: Assembler incompatible with function return value]
 You're trying to implement a \var{assembler} function, but the return type
 of the function doesn't allow that.
\item [Error: Procedure overloading is switched off]
 When using the \var{-So} switch, procedure overloading is switched off.
 Turbo Pascal does not support function overloading.
\item [Error: It is not possible to overload this operator (overload = instead)]
 You are trying to overload an operator which cannot be overloaded.
 The following operators can be overloaded : 
 \begin{verbatim}
    +, -, *, /, =, >, <, <=, >=, is, as, in, **, :=
 \end{verbatim}
\item [Error: Comparative operator must return a boolean value]
 When overloading the \var{=} operator, the function must return a boolean
 value.
\item [Error: Only virtual methods can be abstract]
 You are declaring a method as abstract, when it isn't declared to be
 virtual.
\item [Fatal: Use of unsupported feature!]
 You're trying to force the compiler into doing something it cannot do yet.
\item [Error: The mix of CLASSES and OBJECTS isn't allowed]
 You cannot derive \var{objects} and \var{classes} intertwined . That is,
 a class cannot have an object as parent and vice versa.
\item [Warning: Unknown procedure directive had to be ignored: arg1]
 The procedure direcive you secified is unknown. Recognised procedure
 directives are \var{cdecl}, \var{stdcall}, \var{popstack}, \var{pascal}
 \var{register}, \var{export}.
\item [Error: absolute can only be associated to ONE variable]
 You cannot specify more than one variable before the \var{absolute} directive.
 Thus, the following construct will provide this error:
 \begin{verbatim}
 Var Z : Longint;
     X,Y : Longint absolute Z;
 \end{verbatim}
 \item [ absolute can only be associated a var or const ]
 The address of a \var{absolute} directive can only point to a variable or
 constant. Therefore, the following code will produce this error:
 \begin{verbatim}
   Procedure X;
 
  var p : longint absolute x;
 \end{verbatim}
 
\item [Error: absolute can only be associated a var or const]
 The address of a \var{absolute} directive can only point to a variable or
 constant. Therefore, the following code will produce this error:
 \begin{verbatim}
   Procedure X;
 
  var p : longint absolute x;
 \end{verbatim}
 
\item [Error: Abtract methods shouldn't have any definition (with function body)]
 Abstract methods can only be declared, you cannot implement them. They
 should be overridden by a descendant class.
\item [Error: This overloaded function can't be local (must be exported)]
 You are defining a overloaded function in the implementation part of a unit,
 but there is no corresponding declaration in the interface part of the unit.
\item [Warning: Virtual methods are used without a constructor in arg1]
 If you declare objects or classes that contain virtual methods, you need
 to have a constructor and destructor to initialize them. The compiler
 encountered an object or class with virtual methods that doesn't have 
 a constructor/destructor pair.
\item [Macro defined: arg1]
 When \var{-vm} is used, the compiler tells you when it defines macros.
\item [Macro undefined: arg1]
 When \var{-vm} is used, the compiler tells you when it undefines macros.
\item [Macro arg1 set to arg2]
 When \var{-vm} is used, the compiler tells you what values macros get.
\item [Info: Compiling arg1]
 When you turn on information messages (\var{-vi}), the compiler tells you 
 what units it is recompiling.
\item [Compiling arg1 for the second time]
 When you request debug messages (\var{-vd}) the compiler tells you what
 units it recompiles for the second time.
\item [Error: Array properties aren't allowed at this point]
 You cannot use  array properties at that point.a
\item [Error: No property found to override]
 You want to overrride a property of a parent class, when there is, in fact,
 no such property in the parent class.
\item [Error: Only one default property is allowed, found inherited default property in class arg1]
 You specified a property as \var{Default}, but a parent class already has a
 default property, and a class can have only one default property.
\item [Error: The default property must be an array property]
 Only array properties of classes can be made \var{default} properties. 
\item [Error: Virtual constructors are only supported in class object model]
 You cannot have virtual constructors in objects. You can only have them
 in classes.
\item [Error: No default property available]
 You try to access a default property of a class, but this class (or one of
 it's ancestors) doesn't have a default property.
\item [Error: The class can't have a published section, use the {argM+} switch]
 If you want a \var{published} section in a class definition, you must
 use the \var{\{\$M+\}} switch, whch turns on generation of type
 information.
\item [Error: Forward declaration of class arg1 must be resolved here to use the class as ancestor]
 To be able to use an object as an ancestor object, it must be defined
 first. This error occurs in the following situation:
 \begin{verbatim}
  Type ParentClas = Class;
       ChildClass = Class(ParentClass)
         ...
       end;
 \end{verbatim}
 Where \var{ParentClass} is declared but not defined.
\item [Error: Local operators not supported]
 You cannot overload locally, i.e. inside procedures or function
 definitions.
\item [Error: Procedure directive arg1 not allowed in interface section]
 This procedure directive is not allowed in the \var{interface} section of
 a unit. You can only use it in the \var{implementation} section.
\item [Error: Procedure directive arg1 not allowed in implementation section]
 This procedure directive is not defined in the \var{implementation} section of
 a unit. You can only use it in the \var{interface} section.
\item [Error: Procedure directive arg1 not allowed in procvar declaration]
 This procedure directive cannot be part of a procedural of function
 type declaration.
\item [Error: Function is already declared Public/Forward arg1]
 You will get this error if a function is defined as \var{forward} twice.
 Or it is once in the \var{interface} section, and once as a \var{forward} 
 declaration in the \var{implmentation} section.
\item [Error: Can't use both EXPORT and EXTERNAL]
 These two procedure directives are mutually exclusive
\item [Error: NAME keyword expected]
 The definition of an external variable needs a \var{name} clause.
\item [Warning: arg1 not yet supported inside inline procedure/function]
 Inline procedures don't support this declaration.
\item [Warning: Inlining disabled]
 Inlining of procedures is disabled.
\item [Info: Writing Browser log arg1]
 When information messages are on, the compiler warns you when it
 writes the browser log (generated with the \var{\{\$Y+ \}} switch).
\item [Hint: may be pointer dereference is missing]
 The compiler thinks that a pointer may need a dereference.
\item [Fatal: Selected assembler reader not supported]
 The selected assembler reader (with \var{\{\$ASMMODE xxx\}} is not
 supported. The compiler can be compiled with or without support for a
 particular assembler reader.
\item [Error: Procedure directive arg1 has conflicts with other directives]
 You specified a procedure directive that conflicts with other directives.
 for instance \var{cdecl} and \var{pascal} are mutually exclusive.
\item [Error: Calling convention doesn't match forward]
 This error happens when you declare a function or procedure with 
 e.g. \var{cdecl;} but omit this directive in the implementation, or vice 
 versa. The calling convention is part of the function declaration, and
 must be repeated in the function definition.
\item [Error: Register calling (fastcall) not supported]
 The \var{register} calling convention, i.e., arguments are passed in
 registers instead of on the stack is not supported. Arguments are always
 passed on the stack.
\item [Error: Property can't have a default value]
 Set properties or indexed properties cannot have a default value.
\item [Error: The default value of a property must be constant]
 The value of a \var{default} declared property must be knwon at compile
 time. The value you specified is only known at run time. This happens
 .e.g. if you specify a variable name as a default value.
\item [Error: Symbol can't be published, can be only a class]
 Only class type variables can be in a \var{published} section of a class 
 if they are not declared as a property.
\item [Error: That kind of property can't be published]
 Properties in a \var{published} section cannot be array properties.
 they must be moved to public sections. Properties in a \var{published}
 section must be an ordinal type, a real type, strings or sets.
 \end{description}
 \section{Type checking errors}
 This section lists all errors that can occur when type checking is
 performed.
 \begin{description}
\item [Error: Type mismatch]
 This can happen in many cases:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The variable you're assigning to is of a different type than the
 expression in the assignment.
 \item You are calling a function or procedure with parameters that are 
 incompatible with the parameters in the function or procedure definition.
 \end{itemize}
\item [Error: Integer expression expected]
 The compiler expects an expression of type integer, but gets a different
 type.
\item [Error: Ordinal expression expected]
 The expression must be of ordinal type, i.e., maximum a \var{Longint}.
 This happens, for instance, when you specify a second argument
 to \var{Inc} or \var{Dec} that doesn't evaluate to an ordinal value.
\item [Error: Type identifier expected]
 The identifier is not a type, or you forgot to supply a type identifier.
\item [Error: Variable identifier expected]
 This happens when you pass a constant to a \var{Inc} var or \var{Dec}
 proceure. You can only pass variables as arguments to these functions.
\item [Error: pointer type expected]
 The variable or expression isn't of the type \var{pointer}. This
 happens when you pass a variable that isn't a pointer to \var{New}
 or \var{Dispose}.
\item [Error: class type expected]
 The variable of expression isn't of the type \var{class}. This happens
 typically when
 \begin{enumerate} 
 \item The parent class in a class declaration isn't a class.
 \item An exception handler (\var{On}) contains a type identifier that 
 isn't a class.
 \end{enumerate}
\item [Error: Variable or type indentifier expected]
 The argument to the \var{High} or \var{Low} function is not a variable
 nor a type identifier.
\item [Error: Can't evaluate constant expression]
 No longer in use.
\item [Error: Set elements are not compatible]
 You are trying to take the union of two set, when the set element types
 are not the same. The base type of a set must be the same when taking the
 union 
\item [Warning: Automatic type conversion from floating type to COMP which is an integer type]
 An implicit type conversion from a real type to a \var{comp} is 
 encountered. Since \var{Comp} is a 64 bit integer type, this may indicate
 an error.
\item [Warning: Using / will give a floating point result]
 When using the '/' operator in \fpc the result will be of type real, when
 used with integers.
\item [Hint: use DIV instead to get an integer result]
 When hints are on, then an integer division will procuce this message.
\item [Error: string types doesn't match, because of argV+ mode]
 When compiling in \var{\{\$V+ \}} mode, the string you pass as a parameter
 should be of the exact same type as the declared parameter of the procedure.
\item [Error: succ or pred on enums with assignments not possible]
 When you declared an enumeration type which has assignments in it, as in C,
 like in the following:
 \begin{verbatim}
   Tenum = (a,b,e:=5);
 \end{verbatim}
 you cannot use the \var{Succ} or \var{Pred} functions on them. 
\item [Error: Can't read or write variables of this type]
 You are trying to \var{read} or \var{write} a variable from or to a 
 file of type text, which doesn't support that. Only integer types,
 booleans, reals, pchars and strings can be read from/written to a text file.
\item [Error: Type conflict between set elements]
 There is at least one set element which is of the wrong type, i.e. not of
 the set type.
\item [Error: Integer or real expression expected]
 The first argument to \var{str} must a real or integer type.
 \end{description}
 \section{Symbol handling}
 This section lists all the messages that concern the handling of symbols.
 This means all things that have to do with procedure and variable names.
 \begin{description}
\item [Error: Identifier not found arg1]
 The compiler doesn't know this symbol. Usually happens when you misspel
 the name of a variable or procedure, or when you forgot to declare a
 variable.
\item [Fatal: Internal Error in SymTableStack()]
 An internal error occurred in the compiler; If you encounter such an error,
 please contact the developers and try to provide  an exact description of
 the circumstances in which the error occurs.
\item [Error: Duplicate identifier arg1]
 The identifier was already declared in the current scope.
\item [Error: Unknown identifier arg1]
 The identifier encountered hasn't been declared, or is used outside the
 scope where it's defined.
\item [Error: Forward declaration not solved: arg1]
 This can happen in two cases:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item This happens when you declare a function (in the \var{interface} part, or
 with a \var{forward} directive, but do not implement it.
 \item You reference a type which isn't declared in the current \var{type}
 block.
 \end{itemize}
\item [Fatal: Identifier type already defined as type]
 You are trying to redefine a type.
\item [Error: Error in type defenition]
 There is an error in your definition of a new array type:
 \item One of the range delimiters in an array declaration is erroneous.
 For example, \var{Array [1..1.25]} will trigger this error.
\item [Error: Type identifier not defined]
 The compiler encountered an unknown type.
\item [Error: Only static variables can be used in static methods or outside methods]
 A static method of an object can only access static variables.
\item [Error: Invalid call to tvarsym.mangledname()]
 An internal error occurred in the compiler; If you encounter such an error,
 please contact the developers and try to provide  an exact description of
 the circumstances in which the error occurs.
\item [Fatal: record or class type expected]
 The variable or expression isn't of the type \var{record} or \var{class}.
\item [Error: Instances of classes or objects with an abtsract method are not allowed]
 You are trying to generate an instance of a class which has an abstract
 method that wasn't overridden.
\item [Error: Label not defined arg1]
 A label was declared, but not defined.
\item [Error: Illegal label declaration]
\item [Error: GOTO und LABEL are not supported (use command line switch -Sg)]
\item [Error: Label not found]
 A \var{goto label} was encountered, but the label isn't declared. 
 \item [GOTO and LABEL are not supported (use command line switch -Sg)]
 You must compile a program which has \var{label}s and \var{goto} statements 
 with the  \var{-Sg} switch. By default, \var{label} and \var{goto} aren't
 supported.
\item [Error: identifier isn't a label]
 The identifier specified after the \var{goto} isn't of type label.
\item [Error: label already defined]
 You are defining a label twice. You can define a label only once.
\item [Error: illegal type declaration of set elements]
 The declaration of a set contains an invalid type definition.
\item [Error: Forward class definition not resolved arg1]
 You declared a class, but you didn't implement it.
\item [Hint: Parameter not used arg1]
 This is a warning. The identifier was declared (locally or globally) but
 wasn't used (locally or globally).
\item [Warning: Local variable not used arg1]
 You have declared, but not used a variable in a procedure or function
 implementation.
\item [Error: Set type expected]
 The variable or expression isn't of type \var{set}. This happens in an
 \var{in} statement.
\item [Warning: Function result does not seem to be set]
 You can get this warning if the compiler thinks that a function return
 value is not set. This will not be displayed for assembler procedures, 
 or procedures that contain assembler blocks.
\item [Error: Unknown field identifier]
 The field doesn't exist in the record definition.
\item [Warning: Local variable arg1 does not seem to be initialized]
 This message is displayed if the compiler thinks that a variable will
 be used (i.e. appears in the right-hand-side of an expression) when it
 wasn't initialized first (i.e. appeared in the right-hand side of an
 assigment)
\item [Error: identifier idents no member arg1]
 When using the extended syntax of \var{new}, you must specify the constructor
 method of the class you are trying to create. The procedure you specified
 does not exist.
\item [Found declaration: arg1]
 You get this when you use the \var{-vb} switch. In case an overloaded
 procedure is not found, then all candidate overloaded procedures are
 listed, with their parameter lists.
 \end{description}
 \section{Code generator messages}
 This section lists all messages that can be displayed if the code
 generator encounters an error condition.
 \begin{description}
\item [Error: BREAK not allowed]
 You're trying to use \var{break} outside a loop construction.
\item [Error: CONTINUE not allowed]
 You're trying to use \var{continue} outside a loop construction.
\item [Error: Expression too complicated - FPU stack overflow]
 Your expression is too long for the compiler. You should try dividing the
 construct over multiple assignments.
\item [Error: Illegal expression]
 This can occur under many circumstances. Mostly when trying to evaluate
 constant expressions.
\item [Error: Invalid integer]
 You made an exression which isn't an integer, and the compiler expects the
 result to be an integer.
\item [Error: Illegal qualifier]
 One of the following is happening :
 \begin{itemize}
 \item You're trying to access a field of a variable that is not a record.
 \item You're indexing a variable that is not an array.
 \item You're dereferencing a variable that is not a pointer. 
 \end{itemize}
\item [Error: High range limit < low range limit]
 You are declaring a subrange, and the lower limit is higher than the high
 limit of the range.
\item [Error: Illegal counter variable]
 The type of a \var{for} loop variable must be an ordinal type.
 Loop variables cannot be reals or strings.
\item [Error: Can't determine which overloaded function to call]
 You're calling overloaded functions with a parameter that doesn't correspond
 to any of the declared function parameter lists. e.g. when you have declared
 a function with parameters \var{word} and \var{longint}, and then you call
 it with a parameter which is of type \var{integer}.
\item [Error: Parameter list size exceeds 65535 bytes]
 The I386 processor limits the parameter list to 65535 bytes (the \var{RET}
 instruction causes this)
\item [Error: Illegal type conversion]
 When doing a type-cast, you must take care that the sizes of the variable and
 the destination type are the same. 
\item [Error: File types must be var parameters]
 You cannot specify files as value parameters, i.e. they must always be
 declared \var{var} parameters.
\item [Error: The use of a far pointer isn't allowed there]
 Free Pascal doesn't support far pointers, so you cannot take the address of
 an expression which has a far reference as a result. The \var{mem} construct
 has a far reference as a result, so the following code will produce this
 error:
 \begin{verbatim}
 var p : pointer;
 ...
 p:=@mem[a000:000];
 \end{verbatim}
\item [Error: illegal call by reference parameters]
 You are trying to pass a constant or an expression to a procedure that
 requires a \var{var} parameter. Only variables can be passed as a \var{var}
 parameter.
\item [Error: EXPORT declared functions can't be called]
 No longer in use.
\item [Warning: Possible illegal call of constructor or destructor (doesn't match to this context)]
 No longer in use.
\item [Note: Inefficient code]
 You construction seems dubious to the compiler.
\item [Warning: unreachable code]
 You specified a loop which will never be executed. Example:
 \begin{verbatim}
 while false do
   begin
   {.. code ...}
   end;
 \end{verbatim}
\item [Error: procedure call with stackframe ESP/SP]
 The compiler enocountered a procedure  or function call inside a 
 procedure that uses a \var{ESP/SP} stackframe. Normally, when a call is
 done the procedure needs a \var{EBP} stackframe.
\item [Error: Abstract methods can't be called directly]
 You cannot call an abstract method directy, instead you must call a
 overriding child method, because an abstract method isn't implemented. 
\item [Fatal: Internal Error in getfloatreg(), allocation failure]
 An internal error occurred in the compiler; If you encounter such an error,
 please contact the developers and try to provide  an exact description of
 the circumstances in which the error occurs.
\item [Fatal: Unknown float type]
 The compiler cannot determine the kind of float that occurs in an expression.
\item [Fatal: SecondVecn() base defined twice]
 An internal error occurred in the compiler; If you encounter such an error,
 please contact the developers and try to provide  an exact description of
 the circumstances in which the error occurs.
\item [Fatal: Extended cg68k not supported]
 The var{extended} type is not supported on the m68k platform.
\item [Fatal: 32-bit unsigned not supported in MC68000 mode]
 The cardinal is not supported on the m68k platform.
\item [Fatal: Internal Error in secondinline()]
 An internal error occurred in the compiler; If you encounter such an error,
 please contact the developers and try to provide  an exact description of
 the circumstances in which the error occurs.
\item [Register arg1 weight arg2 arg3]
 Debugging message. Shown when the compiler considers a variable for
 keeping in the registers.
\item [Error: Stack limit excedeed in local routine]
 Your code requires a too big stack. Some operating systems pose limits 
 on the stack size. You should use less variables or try ro put large
 variables on the heap. 
\item [Stack frame is omited]
 Some procedure/functions do not need a complete stack-frame, so it is omitted.
 This message will be displayed when the {-vd} switch is used.
\item [Error: Unable to inline object methods]
 You cannot have inlined object methods.
\item [Error: Unable to inline procvar calls]
 A procedure with a procedural variable call cannot be inlined.
\item [Error: No code for inline procedure stored]
 The compiler couldn't store code for the inline procedure.
 \end{description}
 \section{Unit loading messages.}

\item [PPU Source: arg1]
 When you use the \var{-vt} flag, the unit CRC check is shown.
\item [objectfile and assemblerfile are older than ppufile]
 When you use the \var{-vd} flag, the compiler warns if the assembler of
 object file of the unit are older than the unit file itself.
\item [objectfile is older than assemblerfile]
 When you use the \var{-vd} flag, the compiler warns if the assembler 
 file of the unit is older than the object file of the unit.
\item [Unitsearch: arg1]
 When you use the \var{-vt}, the compiler tells ou where it tries to find
 unt files.
\item [Writing arg1]
 When you specify the \var{-vu} switch, the compiler will tell you where it
 writes the unit file.
\item [Fatal: Can't Write PPU-File]
 An err
\item [Fatal: reading PPU-File]
 This means that the unit file was corrupted, and contains invalid
 information. Recompilation will be necessary.
\item [Fatal: Invalid PPU-File entry: arg1]

 by changing the \var{maxunits} constant in the \file{files.pas} file of the
 compiler, and recompiling the compiler. 
\item [Fatal: Circular unit reference]
 Two units are using each other in the interface part. This is only allowed
 in the \var{implementation} part. At least one unit must contain the other one
 in the \var{implementation} section.
\item [Fatal: Can't compile unit arg1, no sources available]
 A unit was found that needs to be recompiled, but no sources are
 available.
\item [Warning: Compiling the system unit requires the -Us switch]

 \var{-Us} must be specified.
\item [Fatal: There were arg1 errors compiling module, stopping]
 When the compiler encounters a fatal error or too many errors in a module
 then it stops with this message.
 \end{description}
 \section{Command-line handling errors}
 This section lists errors that occur when the compiler is processing the
 command line or handling the configuration files.
 \begin{description}
\item [Warning: Only one source file supported]
 You can specify only one source file on the command line. The first
 one will be compiled, others will be ignored. This may indicate that
 you forgot a \var{'-'} sign.
