\chapter{Using the IDE}

The IDE (\textbf{I}ntegrated \textbf{D}evelopment \textbf{E}nvironment)
provides a comfortable user interface to the compiler, further it
provides a debugger, symbol browser etc. The IDE is a textmode
application this allows the same look and feel for all supported
operating systems. Furthermore, it will be very familiar to all
Turbo Pascal users.
Currently the IDE is available for DOS, Win32 and Linux.

\section{First steps with the IDE}

The IDE is started by entering the command:
\begin{verbatim}
fp
\end{verbatim}
at the command line. Of course, you can also start the IDE
from a graphical user interface (under the Windows enviroment, you
can switch between windowed mode and full screen mode by pressing
Alt-Enter).

\subsection{The IDE screen}

\begin{htmlonly}
The screen of the IDE looks like this after start up:
\htmladdimg{../pics/idestart.gif}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
The screen of the IDE looks like this after start up like figure \ref{fig:idestart}.
\begin{figure}
\caption{The IDE screen immediatly after startup}
\label{fig:idestart}
\ifpdf
\epsfig{file=pics/idestart.pdf,width=\textwidth}
\else
\epsfig{file=pics/idestart.eps,width=\textwidth}
\fi
\end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
At top of the screen you see the menu bar, at the bottom the statusbar.
The empty bar between them is called the desktop.

The statusbar allows a quick access to often used commands by
clicking them with the mouse. Further, it reminds you about often used
keyboard shortcuts.

In upper right corner of the IDE screen a clock is displayed to
remind you to go to bed in time. At lower right corner a you'll
see the current amount of unsed memory. Don't worry if this value
is low the IDE allocates more memory from the operating system
if it runs out of memory.

You can exit from the IDE by selecting \var{File|Exit}\footnote{Select
the item Exit in the menu File} or by pressing
\textsc{Alt-X}.

\begin{remark}
A complete reference of all keyboard shortcuts can be found in the
section \ref{ide:keyshortcuts}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{IDE Command line options}

When starting the IDE, command line options can be passed:
\begin{verbatim}
fp [-option] [-option] ... <file name> ...
\end{verbatim}

Option is one of the following switches (the option letters
aren't case sensitive):

\begin{description}
\item [-N] DOS only: Don't use long file names. Since Win95 an interface
is provided to DOS applications to access long file names. The IDE uses
this interface by default to access files. Under certain circumstances, this
can lead to problems.
\item [-Cfilename] This option followed by (without spaces)
a filename uses the given file to read the options
\item [-R] After starting the IDE, it changes automatically to the directory
which was active when you left the IDE the last time.
\end{description}

Under DOS/Win32, \var{/} can be used instead of \var{\-} to pass a
command line switch to the IDE

Furthermore, the files given at the command line are loaded into edit
windows automatically.

\subsection{Using the mouse}
\label{ide:mouseusage}
If the system is equipped with a mouse, it can be use it to work with the
IDE. The left button is used to select menu items, press buttons, select
text blocks etc. The right mouse button is used to access the local menu.
The local menu isn't always available. Holding down the \textsc{Ctrl} or
\textsc{Alt} key and clicking the right button will
execute user defined functions, see \ref{ide:prefmouse}

\begin{remark}
This manual uses at several places the term "drag the mouse". This
means that you have to move the mouse while keeping the left
mouse button pressed.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
When talking about left and right mouse, it means always that the
mouse buttons aren't reversed, if you want you can exchange the
bavior of the left and right mouse button, see \ref{ide:prefmouse}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Under certain circumstances you won't be able to use the mouse,
even if your system has one:
\begin{itemize}
\item The IDE is running under Linux throught a telnet connection
\item The IDE is running under Linux in a window
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Accessing the menu}
The menu (the gray bar at the top of the IDE) can be accessed by using
the mouse to select items. If you don't use a mouse, you can use
\textsc{F10} to switch the menu. Use the arrow keys to navigate and the Enter
key to select items. To access the menu very fast without leaving the
keyboard with your hands, \textsc{Alt-<highlighted letter>}
can be used, afterwards
menu entries can be selected by pressing also the highlighted letter, but
without \textsc{Alt}. E.g. \textsc{Alt-S G} is a fast way to
display the goto line dialog.

Every menu item is explained by a short text in the statusbar.

In certain cases, a local menu is available. It can be access by pressing
the right mouse button or \textsc{Alt-F10}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Windows
\section{Windows}
In our days, working with windowed applications should be a known
by most users. Nevertheless, the following section describes how
the windows work in the \fpc IDE to allow an efficient work with it.

\subsection{Basics}
\begin{htmlonly}
A common IDE window looks like:
\htmladdimg{../pics/idewin.gif}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Figure \ref{fig:idewin} shows a common IDE edit window.
\begin{figure}
\caption{A common IDE window}
\label{fig:idewin}
\ifpdf
\epsfig{file=pics/idewin.pdf,width=\textwidth}
\else
\epsfig{file=pics/idewin.eps,width=\textwidth}
\fi
\end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
The window is surround by the so called frame, the whith double
line around the window.
At the top of the window you'll see the title bar, it contains the title
of the window (what else?). To move the window click on
the title bar and drag window with the mouse.
If you don't have a mouse, see \ref{ide:keyboardwindow} how
to use the keyboard to work with windows.

At the upper left corner you see the close icon. If you click it the
window will be closed, it can be also closed by pressing \textsc{Alt-F3} or
selecting the menu item \var{Window|Close}. All open windows can be closed
by selecting the menu item \var{Window|Close all}

To resize the window click on the lower left corner of the window
and drag it (move the mouse while holding the left button pressed).
Keyboard users should look at the section \ref{ide:keyboardwindow}.
Not all windows can be resized, for examples dialog windows
(\ref{ide:dialogwindow}) can't be resized.

At the upper right you'll see a green arrow. Clicking this arrow
zooms the window to the whole desktop. If you click this arrow on
a zoomed window, the old size of the window will be restored. Pressing
the key F5 has the same affect as clicking that arrow. Furthermore,
this can be also done by selecting the menu item \var{Window|Zoom}.
Windows which aren't resizeable can't be zoom.

The scrollbars at the right and bottom border can be used to scroll
the window contents with the mouse. Click on the arrows to scroll
line by line and on the dotted area between the arrows and the cyan
rectangle to scroll page by page. By dragging the rectangle you can
scroll continously throught the window contents.

The star and the numbers at the lower left corner
are explained in the section about the editor, see \ref{ide:editingtext}.

\subsection{Working with multiple windows}
When working with larger projects, you'll have multile windows on your
desktop. An inactive window is identified by a greyed frame, you can
activate it, by clicking on the window with the mouse. Or you can
step trought all open windows by pressing \textsc{F6}
(menu item \var{Window|Next}).
To activate the last activated window, press \textsc{Shift-F6}
(menu item \var{Window|Previous}).

If the window has number at the upper
right corner, you can activate it by pressing \textsc{Alt-<number>}.
\textsc{Alt-0} has a special meaning,
it shows a dialog box with all available
windows which allows a quick activation of windows which doesn't have a
number.

Of course, you can order the windows on the IDE desktop by zooming and
resizing them with the mouse or keyboard. Especially with the
keyboard, this is very hard. You can use instead the menu items
\var{Window|Tile} and \var{Window|Cascade}. Tile means that the
whole desktop space is tiled even by all windows. Cascade brings
all windows in a cascaded position. Just try these commands if you've
multiple windows on the IDE desktop.

In very rare cases the screen of the IDE may be mixed up. In this
case the whole IDE screen can be forced to be redrawn by selecting
the menu item \var{Window|Refresh}.

\subsection{Dialog windows}
\label{ide:dialogwindow}
In many cases the IDE displays a dialog window to get user input.
The main difference to other windows is that you can't activate
other windows will the dialog is active. This behavior is called modal.
To activate another window, you've to close a modal window/dialog.

\begin{htmlonly}
A typical dialog window looks like:
\htmladdimg{../pics/idedlg.gif}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Figure \ref{fig:idedlg} shows a typical dialog window.
\begin{figure}
\caption{A typical dialog window}
\label{fig:idedlg}
\ifpdf
\epsfig{file=pics/idedlg.pdf,width=\textwidth}
\else
\epsfig{file=pics/idedlg.eps,width=\textwidth}
\fi
\end{figure}
\end{latexonly}

\subsection{Moving and zooming windows with the keyboard}
\label{ide:keyboardwindow}
To resize/move a window with the keyboard, go into the size/move mode
by pressing \textsc{Ctrl-F5} or selecting the menu item
\var{Window|Size/Move}. Now the window frame will be green. Using the
cursor keys you can move window and pressing shift and the cursor
keys, it can be resized. The size/move mode can be left by pressing
\textsc{Enter} and the window will keep it's size and position
or by pressing \textsc{Esc} and the old size will be restored.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The help system
\section{The help system}
If you are stuck somewhere while editing files, regarding the syntax
of a pascal statment or the behavior of a subroutine of the runtime
library, you can use the help system to get some information. The
help system is called by pressing F1.

\subsection{Navigating in the help system}
The help system contains hyperlinks which can be access by clicking
them with the mouse. Alternativly, \textsc{Tab} and \textsc{Shift-Tab}
can be used to move between the different hyperlinks of a page
and the \textsc{Enter} key can be used to select them.

The contents of the help system is display, if you press \textsc{Shift-F1}.
To go back to the last help topic, \textsc{press Alt-F1}. This works
also if the help window isn't displayed on the window.

\subsection{Working with help files}
The IDE contains a help system which can display HTML files
as well as the TPH format known from TP. Of course, the HTML
viewer of the help system is limited, so forget about displaying
HTML files which use e.g. CSS. It is designed to display the FPC
help files, but feel free to improve it and send us patches...

The menu item \var{Help|Files} allows you to add and delete
help files.

Press the new button to add a new file. You'll be asked for the location
of the help file. If it is a HTML file, a dialog box will be display
which asks for a title, this title will be included in the
contents of help.

A help file can be deleted from the help system (it ISN'T deleted from
your hard disk) by pressing the delete button.

\subsection{The about dialog}
The about dialog (\var{Help|About...}) shows some information
about the IDE, please include versions and dates of this
dialog if you report bugs, have suggestion etc regarding the IDE.
Furthermore, it contains the copyright information.

% The tools menu
\section{The tools menu}
\label{ide:toolsmenu}
The tools menu allows you an easy access to external tools. Further,
it contains two other probaly helpful tools for programmers: an
ascii table and a calculator.

\subsection{The messages window}
The output of the external utilies is redirected by the IDE and it
will be displayed in the message window. The message window is
displayed automatically, if an external tool was run. The
messages window can be also display manual by the selecting the
menu item \var{Tools|Messages} or by pressing the key \textsc{F11}.

If the output of the tools contains filenames and line numbers,
you can goto the source line by pressing \textsc{Enter} or
double clicking the output line. To trace the source, press
\textsc{Space}. The difference between goto and tracking is that
goto closes the message window while tracking keeps the message
window active and the source file is displayed only in the background.

The algorithm which extracts the file names and line numbers from
the tool output is quite sophisticated, but in some cases it may
fail. In this case, please refer the sources of the IDE.

\subsection{GREP}
One external tool in the Tools menu is already predefined: an
menu item to call the \file{grep} utility (\var{Tools|Grep} or
\textsc{Shift-F2}). \file{grep} search for a given string in files and
returns the lines which contain the string. The search string can
be even a regular expression (see \ref{ide:regexpr}).

% Project management
\section{Project management}
\label{ide:projectmanagement}
Lucily, project mangament in pascal is much easier than with C. The
compiler knows from the source which units, sources etc. it needs.
So the \fpc IDE doesn't need a full features project manager like
some C development environments offer. But some things make life easier...

\subsection{The primary file}
Without a primary file the IDE compiles/runs the source of the actived
window when you start your program. If you have specified a primary
file, the IDE compiles/runs always this source, no matter if another
source window is active. Select the menu item \var{Compile|Primary file...}
to get a file dialog where you can enter the primary file. Only the command
\var{Compile|Compile} compiles still the active window, this is usefull
if you have a large project and you want only check the syntax of the
current source.

The menu item \var{Compiler|Clear primary file} restores the default behavior
i.e. the compile and run commands apply to the active window.

\subsection{The switches mode}
The IDE allows you to work with three different sets of compiler
switches: Normal, Debug and Release. The different switch
sets can be selected in the \var{Switches Mode} dialog which
is executed by the menu item \var{Options|Mode...}.
Change the switches mode doesn't do any active switch change, i.e.
the debug mode doesn't include debug information automatically,
it just loads another set of switches which were adjusted before
by the user in the compiler or directory dialog.

\subsection{The directory dialog}
%%%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

\subsection{The target operating system}
The menu item \var{Compile|Target} allows you to specify the target
operating system. Changing the target doesn't affect any compiler
switches or directories.

\subsection{The configuration files}
%%%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Customize the IDE
\section{Customize the IDE}
The IDE is configurable in a wide range, you can change colors, screen
resolution etc. The configuration setting can reached via the
submenu \var{Environment} in the \var{Options} menu.

\subsection{Mouse}
\label{ide:prefmouse}
The mouse options dialog is called by the menu item
\var{Options|Environment|Mouse}. You can use the slider to adjust the
double clock speed. If you're left handed you can exchange the
behavior of the left and right mouse button by checking the checkbox
item \var{Reverse mouse buttons}.

The two lists with the radio buttons allows you
to configure the behavior of the
right mouse button, if it is clicked together while
pressing the \textsc{Ctrl} or
\textsc{Alt} key in an edit window.

The following actions can be assigned to \textsc{Ctrl}-right mouse button or
\textsc{Alt}-right mouse button:

\begin{description}
\item [Topic search] The keyword at the mouse cursor is searched in the
help index
\item [Go to cursor] The program is executed until the line where
the mouse cursor is located
\item [Breakpoint] Set a breakpoint at the mouse cursor position
\item [Evalute] Evaluate the value of the variable at the mouse
cursor
\item [Add watch] Add the variable at the mouse cursor to the
watch window
\item [Browse symbol] The symbol at the mouse cursor is displayed
by the browser
