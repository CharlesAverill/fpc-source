<H1>Searching in the Free Pascal manual pages</H1>

Searching in the manuals needs two steps :
<OL>
<LI>
To search for words, type the words you want to search for in the
top edit box. You can separate words with <TT>and</TT>, <TT>or</TT>
and <TT>not</TT>. After you typed the words, press the <TT>Search</TT>
button.

For example, you could type the following:
<PRE>
reset or assign
</PRE>
This would then look for pages that have 'assign' or 'reset' in them.
After pressing the <TT>SEARCH</TT> button, the output would look
something like
<IMG SRC="help1.gif">
<P>
When you press the <TT>SEARCH</TT> button, the 'hit total' will be displayed.
This is the number of times your combination of words was found.
<P>
It is possible that no words are found, in that case the hit total will be zero,
and there will be a line 'No records found' in the listbox, as shown below:
<IMG SRC="help2.gif">
<LI> When the search is complete, the lower listbox contains a list of section titles.
You can select one of these titles, and press the <TT>GO</TT> button. A new browser
window will open, showing the page that contains the help you requested.
You can repeat this as many times as you want.
