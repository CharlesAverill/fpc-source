========================= Fixes to apply ==============================

The GO32 mouse.inc (API) displays a message ("No mouse driver found!") when
it doesn't find a mouse driver. This message should be removed.

========================= Already fixed ================================

 [*] when saving a file with different name (or saving a new file) the
     default extension of '.pas' wasn't applied to the name specified
 [*] THelpViewer didn't care about LockFlag, and thus flickered on complex
     updates
 [*] sever sheets of the symbol browser were selectable thru keyboard, even
     when they were disabled/non-visible
 [*] Ctrl--> and Ctrl-<- skipped over '[' and ']'
 [*] unsaved new windows (nonamexx.pas) aren't stored to desktop file any more
     (on the next startup the IDE tried to open the file with no name)
 [*] clock view didn't stay in the upper left corner when the desktop has been
     resized (for ex. at video-mode change)
 [*] the IDE didn't switch correctly between video modes
     (especially 80x50 caused trouble)
 [*] buttons in Breakpoints window didn't move when resizing the window
 [*] tracking source didn't work correctly (for ex. in symbol browser,msgs,..)
 [*] symbol browser didn't respond to Ctrl+Enter (goto source)
 [*] symbol browser views' behaviour unified
 [*] BuildObjectTree failed to build the object tree correctly when there were
     multiple objects defined with the same name. for ex. in object pascal mode
     there are 2 objects called TObject (the built-in base object for classes
     and the one in objects.pp) and thus the entire object tree of TObject
     object was "lost"
 [*] in the linking state the text 'Please wait...' is displayed now, instead
     of 'Press Esc to cancel' (which won't work and is incorrect)
 [+] Inheritance symbol viewer scrolls now, and acts on [Ctrl+]Left,Right keys

========================== Other improvements ============================

 [+] at startup the IDE checks whether there's a file called FP.ANS in any
     of the search directories, and if it founds one, then loads it as the
     background for the desktop (the file is interpreted as an ANSI file)
     (Peter, you can finally put your favorite FPC-logo on your desktop now ;)
 [+] 'Auto track source' option implemented (-> symbol browser)
 [+] 'Compiler messages' window is only shown when there's something to
     display (ie. if there's no error/message, then it won't be shown)

=========================== Todo ========================================
