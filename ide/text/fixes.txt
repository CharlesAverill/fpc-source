Gabors's log to 29/5/2000 commits
========================= Already fixed ================================

 [*] TOAHelpFile.Init contained a bug, which caused an invalid pointer
     operation when the help file version was incorrect (it resulted in
     fatal exit)
 [*] the cursor position in TSymbolScopeView was independant of the current
     horizontal scroll offset
 [*] the value of string constant wasn't displayed correctly in the symbol
     browser (they were typecasted to PStrings, however they are PChars now)
 [*] partial syntax highlight messed up CodeComplete
 [*] the HTML link scanner wasn't aware of bookmark links

========================== Other improvements ============================

 [+] added support for TP5.5 format help files

========================= Already fixed ================================

 [*] a just freshly created editor window (without any chars entered) simply
     "ate" all Save commands

========================== Other improvements ============================

 [+] source paths are now "adjusted" to show only important path elements
     when they don't fit in the title area of the source window
 [+] template macros implemented (you can use them in the .PT files)
     $TIME - actual time
     $DATE - actual date
     $DATE('yyyy/mm/dd hh.nn.ss') - actual date formatted using specified str
     $PROMPT('paramname') - variable parameter entered by user
 [+] the size of some windows is now dependant on the current resolution
 [+] all IDE strings contants converted to resourcestrings
 [+] /hm command-line switch for enabling/disabling heap monitor

=========================== Todo ========================================

 [!] convert all API,FV,etc. message strings to resourcestrings
 [!] add "Find in files" command, probably using internal grep routine
 [!] implement Projects & project managment
     - specifying project files
     - todo list mangment
     - generating project list file

========================= Fixes to apply ==============================

The GO32 mouse.inc (API) displays a message ("No mouse driver found!") when
it doesn't find a mouse driver. This message should be removed.

========================= Already fixed ================================

 [*] when saving a file with different name (or saving a new file) the
     default extension of '.pas' wasn't applied to the name specified
 [*] THelpViewer didn't care about LockFlag, and thus flickered on complex
     updates
 [*] sever sheets of the symbol browser were selectable thru keyboard, even
     when they were disabled/non-visible
 [*] Ctrl--> and Ctrl-<- skipped over '[' and ']'
 [*] unsaved new windows (nonamexx.pas) aren't stored to desktop file any more
     (on the next startup the IDE tried to open the file with no name)
 [*] clock view didn't stay in the upper left corner when the desktop has been
     resized (for ex. at video-mode change)
 [*] the IDE didn't switch correctly between video modes
     (especially 80x50 caused trouble)
 [*] buttons in Breakpoints window didn't move when resizing the window
 [*] tracking source didn't work correctly (for ex. in symbol browser,msgs,..)
 [*] symbol browser didn't respond to Ctrl+Enter (goto source)
 [*] symbol browser views' behaviour unified
 [*] BuildObjectTree failed to build the object tree correctly when there were
     multiple objects defined with the same name. for ex. in object pascal mode
     there are 2 objects called TObject (the built-in base object for classes
     and the one in objects.pp) and thus the entire object tree of TObject
     object was "lost"
 [*] in the linking state the text 'Please wait...' is displayed now, instead
     of 'Press Esc to cancel' (which won't work and is incorrect)
 [+] Inheritance symbol viewer scrolls now, and acts on [Ctrl+]Left,Right keys

========================== Other improvements ============================

 [+] at startup the IDE checks whether there's a file called FP.ANS in any
     of the search directories, and if it founds one, then loads it as the
     background for the desktop (the file is interpreted as an ANSI file)
     (Peter, you can finally put your favorite FPC-logo on your desktop now ;)
 [+] 'Auto track source' option implemented (-> symbol browser)
 [+] 'Compiler messages' window is only shown when there's something to
     display (ie. if there's no error/message, then it won't be shown)

=========================== Todo ========================================

Gabor's log for 18/4/2000 commits

========================= Already fixed ================================

 [*] THTMLTopicRenderer didn't handle table tags (<TABLE>,<TR>,<TH>,<TD>)
 [*] the IDE didn't prompt the user for saving modified files at exit, when
     there were multiple editor windows open for the same file
 [*] the IDE didn't respond to some hotkeys (for ex. Alt+F3) after a success-
     ful compilation

========================== Other improvements ============================

 [+] HTML index generation added. This enables users to index any collection
     of HTML files, for ex. the HTML version of the FPC docs.
     This way we can finally get a WinAPI help for the IDE. The user simply
     has to download a .chm version of the WinAPI help, decompile it with the
     M$ HTML Help Workshop, and install it as a help file...
     (however this will only work in a DOS box under W9X, or with the win32
     version of IDE, as these HTML files use long filenames)
 [+] TCodeEditor acts now on several additional keys, like
     Ctrl+O+A - Open at cursor      , Ctrl+O+B - Browse at cursor      ,
     Ctrl+O+G - Go to line number   , Ctrl+O+O - Insert options        ,
     Ctrl+O+U - Toggle case of char , Ctrl+O+L - Select line           ,
     Ctrl+K+S - Save file           , Ctrl+K+D - Activate menubar      ,
     Ctrl+K+N - Block to uppercase  , Ctrl+K+O - Block to lowercase    ,
     Ctrl+K+E - Word to lowercase   , Ctrl+K+F - Word to uppercase     ,
     Ctrl+Q+E - Jump to top of wnd  , Ctrl+Q+T - Jump to top of wnd    ,
     Ctrl+Q+U - Jump to bottom of wnd,Ctrl+Q+X - Jump to bottom of wnd ,
     Ctrl+Q+[ - find delimiter-match, Ctrl+Q+] - find delimited match (backw)

=========================== Todo ========================================
