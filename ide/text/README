You can have a fp.cfg file in the same directory as fp.exe. It works the
same as ppc386.cfg

If you want to create a fully working IDE you need to compile with a
unit path to ../.. and for an IDE without compiler compile with ../fake

# IDE with full compiler compile with:
ppc386 fp -Fu../..

# IDE with fake compiler compile with:
ppc386 fp -Fu../fake
