--- To do ---

* Most editor-actions are not aware if current selection, eg.
  a line insertion does not shift the start and/or the end of the selection.
* Implement Help|Files...
* Implement missing option dialogs in Options menu, and
* store settings & options
* User screen

--- Ideas ---

* Integrated source beautifier (fully configurable)
* Add some other classes to syntax highlight
  (eg. highlight standard Pascal types, etc.)
