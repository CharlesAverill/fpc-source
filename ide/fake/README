This directory contains fake versions which can be used for IDE development
to leave out some parts of the IDE by replacing them with dummy functions.

compiler/	contains a fake compiler
gdb/            contains a fake gdb interface


Fake compiler
-------------
The only thing it does is when you compile it writes some info lines to the
do_comment() function, which is normally called by the compiler.

Currently it gives an info line that it is a fake compiler and on the second
line the specified commandline


Fake gdb
--------
This contains only the unit gdbcon. Normally the gdbint unit won't be used
directly by your program.
