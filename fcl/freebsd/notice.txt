This directory is only temporarily, to ease working on FPC/FreeBSD 1.0.2
packaging. After that is done, the API and FCL will be restructured like the
RTL. (linux - unix - freebsd structure)

This dir is a plain copy from the api/linux dir with some small substitutions in
makefile.fpc (to select the right target)
