Free Pascal XML units
---------------------

DOM:
Implements most of the DOM level 1 specification and supports some of the
DOM level 2 extensions.

XMLRead:
Provides a simple XML reader, which can read XML data from a file or stream.
This simple parser will be replaced by a much improved one soon, which will be
able to handle different character encodings, namespaces and entity references.
(This parser cannot handle entity references correctly! And I don't plan to fix
this old parser as this is much work. Additionally, it reads the file directly,
i.e. it doesn't support Unicode or different charsets yet.)

XMLWrite:
Writes a DOM structure as XML data into a file or stream. It can deal both with
XML files and XML fragments.
At the moment it supports only the node types which can be read by XMLRead.
Please note that the writer replaces the '"' character in attribute values with
'&quot;' and the '<' character in text nodes with '&lt;'. As this are entity
references ('quot' and 'lt' are predefined entities in XML), the reader won't
be able to read such files!
