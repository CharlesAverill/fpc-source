This is the Database directory of the Free Component Library.

At the moment, there is a read-only implementation of TDataset.
Also, there is no (tested) blob support yet.

Compiling:

Just run 'make' and all should go fine, provided
1) The mysql unit is in the compiler path
2) the mysqlclient library is in /usr/lib
if these conditions are not satisfied, you should edit the makefile
and add -Fl/path/to/libmysqlclient to NEEDOPTS as well as
the -Fu/path/to/mysql/unit option.


there are 2 descendents to demonstrate/test the TDataset:

TddgDataset : 

  Implemented in ddg_ds and ddg_rec. The dataset as
  implemented in the Delphi 4 Developers Guide.
  To test it, do a 
   createds filename
   testds filename
  the first creates a flat file, filled with 100 records;
  the second tests the methods of TDataset on this file.

TMySQLdataset :
  Implemented in mysqldb. You need the mysql units for this.
  This is a temporary implementation based on the code from
     Rangel Gustavo Reale (hitnrun@geocities.com) 
  it will be used as a base for the DBdataset scalable dataset
  implemntation.
  To test it, do a 
     mtest db user pwd SQL
  this will run the query SQL on the database db with user
  'user' and password 'pwd', and dump the result. Take care
  that you don't specify blob fields.
  To test it on the table created by the mkdb shell script
  that comes with the Free Pascal mysql unit, I did a
      mtest test michael pwd 'select * from FPdev'

  I haven't tested Date or time fields yes, just string,float and
  integer fields.

Enjoy !

Michael.
