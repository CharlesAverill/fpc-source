This is first working release of TDatabase and TDataset 
implementation for Interbase SQL server.

Compiling the units:

Run 'make; make examples' command, if something goes wrong, look if you have

  1) unit ibase60 in compiler path
  2) gds.so.0 library in /usr/lib
  
Command 'sh mkdb' creates testing database in current directory.
  
Unit interbase.pp was made and tested on Linux, on ib60 server,
I don't know if it's working on other OS platforms or other
versions of IB server.

Unit in these days provides objective connectivity to IB server, 
basic SQL statement support. It's still buggy, so volunteers
and contributors are welcome. It supports SQL dialect 1 only 
(You cannot use date & time datatypes in tables).
