This is the ncurses interface for Free Pascal.

You need at least version 0.99.8 to compile this.

Compiling should be as simple as 
make install
this will compile the unit ncurses, and make the two programs.
the ncurses unit will be installed in the directory you set in 
the makefile.

If the ncurses library is not in /usr/lib, it is possible that
you must set a -Fl/path/to/libncurses/dir option when compiling the
programs.

The firework program is a nice program that is in the test suite of ncurses
the testn program shows how to make a small window and set a border and
colors, and display a string in it.

Enjoy !
