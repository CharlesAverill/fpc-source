This is the FPC translation of the C library header files.
This unit is meant to
- Give full access to the GNU libc library functionality.
- Be compatible to Borland's Libc.pas unit.

There will often exist 2 versions of a function call: one with a 
pointer type argument - this is  the straight translation of a libc call.
One is with a var/const argument, this is a more 'pascal' like call,
which is usually also the way Borland did it.

Each C header file has been translated to an .inc file. 
The translation of header file xxx.h is named xxxh.inc. 
If macros were converted, they are in a file xxx.inc

All files are included in libc.pp and their origin is noted there.

the file glue.inc is meant to form a bridge between the pascal
and C types, and to take care of some problems in the ordering 
of the header files.

The translation was done on a SuSE 8.1 machine:
Kernel version: 2.4.18
glibc version: 2.3
