GL (OpenGl, MesaGl...) units for Free Pascal
============================================
(c) 1999 Sebastian Guenther, sguenther@gmx.de


This package contains all units required for writing applications for OpenGl
or OpenGl like libraries. In fact, this units have been derived from the
header files of Brian Paul's MesaGl library.
In Delphi, many people use Erik Ungerer's OpenGl header conversion, which is
more powerful than the provided opengl32 unit by Borland/Inprise. My units
work quite the same way (regarding the handling of pointer arguments and
dynamic loading of the libraries), so it should be simple to use source
written for Delphi in Free Pascal.

All units come under the LGPL license, like the original MesaGl headers.

Currently, no further documentation is available. A simple demo application
which uses the GLUT library is being provided.


What comes with this package; current state
-------------------------------------------

(all parts)
  - only tested under Linux with MesaGl 3.1. Even if the units would compile
    under Win32, There _will_ be problems because the units won't use the
    right dynamic loading functions.

GL support
  * Supports all known OpenGl commands
  * Dynamic loading of function pointers ensures that the unit supports
    all OpenGl versions.
  - GL extensions are not loaded automatically

GLU support

GLX support (Linux only)
  - not tested with xlib unit from xforms package (see below)

GLUT support (unit "glut.pp")
  - not all functions are supported

XLib
  This unit contains some important declarations from xlib.h & friends, they
  are required under Linux for GLX support. There is a more complete XLib unit
  available as part of the xforms package (see Free Pascal homepage ->
  contributed units page)

demos/glutdemo
  A simple demo which uses the GLUT library for window creation etc.


Enjoy!
