Free Pascal GL* (GL, GLU, GLUT, GLX) Units
(c) 1999-2000 Sebastian Guenther, sg@freepascal.org


subdirectory "build"
--------------------
This directory contains tools which create the sources of the real GL* units
based on some template files. It contains its own README file, look there for
further informations.


subdirectory "linux"
--------------------
Contains the GL* units for Linux; currently you can use all GL, GLU and GLX
functions as well as most GLUT functions. Automatic loading of GL extensions
is not supported yet, but is planned for the future.
Under Linux, the GL* units try to locate the underlying libraries at run-time;
they search for the libraries in the following order:

GL: (includes GLX)
    1. libGL.so
    2. libGL.so.1
    3. libMesaGL.so.3

GLU:
    1. libGLU.so
    2. libGLU.so.1
    3. libMesaGLU.so.3

GLUT:
    1. libglut.so
    2. libglut.so.3

This should work on all more recent Linux installations.


The GL unit has a variable called "GLDumpUnresolvedFunctions", and the GLUT
unit one called "GLUTDumpUnresolvedFunctions". Set them to True in your
applications if you want to get all function names dumped to the console
which couldn't be resolved, i.e. which are not available in the loaded
libraries.


=== gtkglarea: ===

Additionally, there is an adaption for the gtkglarea (GTK GL area widget)
available; as gtkglarea uses the XLib it is only available for Linux here.


subdirectory "examples"
-----------------------
Only contains a test program called "glutdemo" at the moment, which
demonstrates the use of the GL and GLUT units.



Have fun,
Sebastian
