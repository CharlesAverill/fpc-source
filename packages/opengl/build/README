Free Pascal GL* Units

buildgl.pp
----------
This unit only contains the class "TDefReader", which reads .def files and
holds the informations in the read .def file.


c_linuxd.pp
-----------
This program creates the Linux units "linux/gl.pp" and "linux/glut.pp".


*.def
-----
These are definition files, which hold all declarations common to all
platforms. It may contain two sections:
All lines between "%COPY_INTERFACE" and "%END" are just inserted into the
interface section of generated units; the lines between "%PROCS" and "%END"
are procedure and function definitions. Comments are preserved.
Comments within the .def file (which don't appear in generated units) have
a "#" character at the beginning of the line.


*.tpl
-----
Template files; these files are the skeleton for the generated units. Within
a template file, lines beginning with "%" mark special positions where the
generator inserts its stuff read and possibly converted from .def files.
