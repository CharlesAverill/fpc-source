This directory contains a C memory manager unit. 

The purpose of the cmem unit is simply to replace the standard Free Pascal
memory manager by the memory manager of the C library.

This has some drawbacks since the following calls are not supported then:
MemSize
HeapSize
MemAvail
MaxAvail
This is because the C memory manager doesn't provide this functionality.

To use the unit, put it as the *FIRST* unit in the 'uses' clause of
your program. If it is not put first, some units may use the default 
Free Pascal memory manager before the C memory manager is installed,
thus possibly causing conflicts.

Enjoy !

Michael.
