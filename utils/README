This dirctory contains some utilities that come with the Free Pascal
Compiler. They can be compiled by typing 'make all' in this directory,
or 'make utils_all' in the top directory.

Currently, the following things are provided:

ppudump : This program prints the contents of a unit (.ppu or .ppl) file
          to screen. It should handle units of all versions of the compiler.

ppumove : Similar to tpumove from Borland, Inc. this program can be used
          to combine several (or one) units in a shared or static library.
          usage is straightforward. running the program without arguments
          gives possible arguments.

ppdep   : Creates a makefile which includes all interdependant units.

ptop    : Pascal source beautifier

h2pas/  : Contains the h2pas program, which converts C header files to pascal
          unit files.

Typing a 'make install' will put everything into place.

Happy Coding !
