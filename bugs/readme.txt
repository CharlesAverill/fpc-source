This directory contains test files for various FPC bugs.
The most files are very simple and it's neccessary to check the assembler
output.

The first coloumn contains the file name. If the file name is indended,
the bug is fixed and the last coloumn contains the version where
the bug is fixed.

In future, please add also your name short cut, when fixing a bug.

Unproducable bugs:
------------------
bug0048.pp   shows a problem with putimage on some computers
             (I can't reproduce the bug neither with a Millenium II
              nor a Trio64 card (FK)  )
             (maybe fixed : there was a problem in SetVESAmode for cards
              that use a different read and write window !!
              0.99.9  (PM) )


Unfixed not important bugs (mostly incompatibilities):
------------------------------------------------------
bug0111.pp   blockread(typedfile,...) is not allowed in TP7
bug0133.pp   object type declaration not 100% compatibile with TP7
bug0193.pp   overflow checking for 8 and 16 bit operations wrong
             overflow are just special range checks so
             as all operations are done on 32 bit integers in FPC
             overflow checking will only trap 32 bit overflow
             you have to use range checks for byte or 16 bit integers
bug0243.pp   Arguments of functions are computed from right to left this
             is against pascal convention
             but only BP respects this convention Delphi and GPC also
             use right to left pushing !!

Unfixed bugs:
-------------
bug0232.pp   const. procedure variables need a special syntax
             if they use calling specification modifiers
