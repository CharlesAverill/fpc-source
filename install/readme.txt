                            Free Pascal Compiler

                               Version 0.99.12


****************************************************************************
* Intro
****************************************************************************

This package contains a freeware 32-bit pascal compiler for 386+. The language
and the runtime library are more or less compatible to TP 7.0. Some Delphi
additions have also been implemented like exceptions and rtti.

Free Pascal is currently available for the following platforms:
- DOS, via the DJ Delorie's GO32V1 and GO32V2 Dos extenders
- Linux (i386), both aout and elf
- OS/2 & DOS, via the EMX extender
- Win32 (Win32s, Win95/98 and WinNT)
- Commodore Amiga
- Atari ST

More platforms will be supported in the future.


****************************************************************************
* Features
****************************************************************************

- high speed compiler
- fully 32-bit code
- code optimizer:
  - peephole optimizer
  - loading of variables into registers
  - assembler level dataflow analyzer
  - stack frame eliminations
- language features:
  - almost fully compatible with Borland Pascal
  - long strings, ansi strings
  - partially compatible with Borland Delphi
  - procedure overloading
  - operator overloading
- integrated BASM (built-in assembler) parser
  - supports ATT syntax used by GNU C
  - supports Intel syntax used by Turbo Pascal

  - Netwide assembler (Nasm)
  - Microsoft Assembler/Turbo Assembler (Masm/Tasm)
- can call external C code
- smartlinking
- support for the GNU debugger
- cross-platform API
- IDE (currently for GO32v2 and Win32 only)
- can create binaries running natively under both DOS and OS/2 (EMX version)

****************************************************************************

Quick start
-----------
Download dos09912.zip (version for DOS) or w3209912.zip (version for
Win9x/NT) or os209912.zip (EMX version - for OS/2 and DOS) and unzip it
into a temporary directory.

Start the install program INSTALL.EXE and follow the instructions.

Don't forget to set the path as mentioned by the install program.

To test the compiler, change to the demo directory of the compiler
and type
        ppc386 hello          or          ppos2 hello    (for EMX version)
        hello

* The packages of the distribution
****************************************************************************

All standard packages contain a part that is specific for the target platform
and a few files which are target independent. All files are also available
as separate files to reduce file size if the default file is too big.
