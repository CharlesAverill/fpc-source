Free Pascal for DEBIAN
----------------------

No changes were necessary to the source tree as checked out from
CVS at cvs.freepascal.org by
 cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.freepascal.org:/FPC/CVS -z3 co -r RELEASE_1_0_8 fpc
The Debian Build Directory was created by 'make debcopy FPC_VERSION=1.0.8'
and then duplicated to .orig before 'dpkg-buildpackage -sa -rfakeroot' was
run.

In order to build the package yourself, you need a ppc386 compiler
later or equal to 1.0.4. And you need to change the following settings
in /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf to use (at least) the specified values:
 hash_extra = 10000
 pool_size = 250000
 max_strings = 30000

You'll probably need to run

fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex

as root before first building this package -- see bug #70668 for more
details, at http://bugs.debian.org/70668.


As shipped, only the .pdf docs are built. You may want to make the HTML
files with latex2html by yourself, and eventually adapt the doc-base file.

To create a new config file for fpc (/etc/fpc.cfg) use the command:
 /usr/lib/fpc/1.0.8/samplecfg /usr/lib/fpc/1.0.8
However, you should be aware, that said file /etc/fpc.cfg is
declared as a conffile since version 1.0.2.

Free Vision (fp-fv) had to be removed due to licesing issues.
It will return into the distribution as soon as these issues are resolved.

And, yes - this is a i386 only package currently.
