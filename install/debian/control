Description: Free Pascal Compiler
 The Free Pascal Compiler is a Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Delphi compatible 32bit
 Pascal Compiler. It comes with fully TP 7.0 compatible run-time library.
 Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading. Shared
 libraries can be linked and created. Basic Delphi support is already
 implemented (classes,exceptions,ansistrings). This package contains
 the commandline compiler. You need at least the RTL package before you
 can start compiling anything.
