.SH SYNOPSIS

.B fpcmake [filename [filename [filename]]]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B fpcmake
reads a 
.I Makefile.fpc
and converts it to a 
.I Makefile
suitable for reading by GNU 
.I make
to compile your projects. It is similar in functionality to GNU 
.I autoconf 
or 
.I Imake
for making X projects.

.SH USAGE

.B fpcmake
accepts filenames of makefile description files as it's command-line
arguments. For each of these files it will create a 
.I Makefile 
in the same directory where the file is located, overwriting any other 
existing file.

If no options are given, it just attempts to read the file 
.I Makefile.fpc
in the current directory and tries to construct a Makefile from it.
any previously existing 
.I Makefile
will be erased. See 
.BR fpcmake (5)
for a description of the format of the
.I Makefile.fpc
file.
