Run the MPW script 'prepare' to create an installer package (as a stuffit archive).

The installer package will consist of:

1) 'Installer README' (renamed to README in the installer package)

2) 'Install' (which in the installer package will get creator 'MPSX', so
              that when doubleclicked, it will be run by ToolServer )

3) A FreePascal folder, containing all files to be installed.
