Welcome to Free Pascal for MPW on classic Mac OS
================================================

How to install:
---------------

1. If  yo do not have MPW, please install MPW first.
   MPW can be obtained for free from Apple.

2. Double click the file "Install". This will launch an
   install script (via the ToolServer application, which is
   included in MPW).

3. If it is the first time you install Free Pascal,
   the install script will ask where you want to create the
   FreePascal folder.

4. The installer will copy necessary files to the
   FreePascal folder, create an fpc.cfg file,
   and also add a startup script in 
   the Startup Items folder in the MPW folder.

5. Done.


Tips
----

If you want to compile large programs, and in particular the rtl or
the compiler itself, please increase the memory setting of
MPW to 50 MB and ToolServer to 30 MB.

An upgrade to MPW Shell 3.6b1 is recommended
