FPC demo package
================
This packages contains the following subdirs:

- text     text mode demos (should run everywhere)
- graph    demos those use the graph unit (runs nearly everywhere)
           includes gameunit (text&graph), outputs to another subdir level
- modex    demos those make extensive use of modeX (runs with go32v2 only)
- win32    demos those are win32 specific
- linux    demos those are linux specific
- os2      demos those are OS/2 specific
- palmos   demos those are palmos specific (dragonball)
- netware  demos those are netware(clib) specific
- netwlibc demos those are netware(libc) specific

To build the programs simply type 'make' in the base dir. Do do
a cross build, type make OS_TARGET=crosstarget, i.e.
make OS_TARGET=win32

If you want to add further samples, edit Makefile.fpc
and rebuild the real Makefile by entering 'fpcmake -T all'.
This is a special fpc generic utility to simplify
platform independent makefile generation for the user.
