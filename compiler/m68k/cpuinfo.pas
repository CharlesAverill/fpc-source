  $Log$
  Revision 1.8  2004-01-30 12:17:18  florian
    * fixed some m68k compilation problems

  Revision 1.7  2003/11/07 15:58:32  florian
    * Florian's culmutative nr. 1; contains:
      - invalid calling conventions for a certain cpu are rejected
      - arm softfloat calling conventions
      - -Sp for cpu dependend code generation
      - several arm fixes
      - remaining code for value open array paras on heap

  Revision 1.6  2002/12/14 15:02:03  carl
    * maxoperands -> max_operands (for portability in rautils.pas)
    * fix some range-check errors with loadconst
    + add ncgadd unit to m68k
    * some bugfix of a_param_reg with LOC_CREFERENCE

  Revision 1.5  2002/09/07 20:53:28  carl
    * cardinal -> longword

  Revision 1.4  2002/09/07 15:25:13  peter
    * old logs removed and tabs fixed

  Revision 1.3  2002/08/15 15:15:55  carl
    * jmpbuf size allocation for exceptions is now cpu specific (as it should)
    * more generic nodes for maths
    * several fixes for better m68k support

  Revision 1.2  2002/08/12 15:08:44  carl
    + stab register indexes for powerpc (moved from gdb to cpubase)
    + tprocessor enumeration moved to cpuinfo
    + linker in target_info is now a class
    * many many updates for m68k (will soon start to compile)
    - removed some ifdef or correct them for correct cpu

  Revision 1.1  2002/08/11 08:06:09  carl
    + try to commit this ** file again

  Revision 1.7  2002/05/18 13:34:26  peter
    * readded missing revisions

  Revision 1.6  2002/05/16 19:46:53  carl
  + defines.inc -> fpcdefs.inc to avoid conflicts if compiling by hand
  + try to fix temp allocation (still in ifdef)
  + generic constructor calls
  + start of tassembler / tmodulebase class cleanup

  Revision 1.4  2002/05/13 19:52:46  peter
    * a ppcppc can be build again

  Revision 1.3  2002/04/07 13:43:11  carl
  - moved type constant
