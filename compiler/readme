This directory contains the sources of the Free Pascal Compiler

To recompile the compiler, use the batch file
mppc386.bat

If you want to build a m68k version to cross compile from i386 to m68k
use the batch file
mppc68k.bat

If you want to modify the compiler, please read first the compiler
writer's guide (cws.txt) in that directory.


Changes in the syntax or semantic of FPC:
-----------------------------------------
  28/01/99 : implicit conversion from boolean to integer is not possible
             anymore (solved several bugs) but this could lead to errors
             on previously accepted code (PM)
  01/02/99:  c styled comments are supported (/* ... */), mainly
             for the Sibyl sources of Medigo (FK)
