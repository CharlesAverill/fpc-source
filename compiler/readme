This directory contains the sources of the Free Pascal Compiler

To recompile the compiler, use the batch file
mppc386.bat

If you want to build a m68k version to cross compile from i386 to m68k
use the batch file
mppc68k.bat

If you want to modify the compiler, please read first the compiler
writer's guide (cws.txt) in that directory.


Changes in the syntax or semantic of FPC:
-----------------------------------------
  28/01/99 : implicit conversion from boolean to integer is not possible
             anymore (solved several bugs) but this could lead to errors
             on previously accepted code (PM)
  01/02/99:  c styled comments are supported (/* ... */), mainly
             for the Sibyl sources of Medigo (FK)
  02/02/99:  class destructors take now two parameters: flag
             if the helper routine should free the instance and
             self pointer (FK)
  22/02/99:  PROTECTED and PRIVATE have now the same behavior
             as in TP
  09/03/99   small records and arrays passed by value to a function are now directly copied
             into a 4 bytes parameter (needed for C and DLL calls) (PM)
  11/03/99   the makefile.fpc is now also needed for the compiler and RTL, you can
             find it in the base.zip package (PFV)
  24/03/99   new directives UNITPATH,INCLUDEPATH,OBJECTPATH,LIBRARYPATH to
             set the searchpaths where to find the files for that module (PFV)
