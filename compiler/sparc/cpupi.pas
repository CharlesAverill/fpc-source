stack frame reserves space for them. Arguments beond the sixth reside on the
stack as in the Intel architecture,

standard calling sequence does not define a maximum stack frame size, nor does
it restrict how a language system uses the "unspecified" areas of the standard
stack frame.}

    * aktprocdef renamed to current_procdef
    * procinfo renamed to current_procinfo
    * procinfo will now be stored in current_module so it can be
      cleaned up properly
