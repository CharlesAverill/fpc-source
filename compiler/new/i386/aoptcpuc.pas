  Revision 1.3  2000-01-07 01:14:57  peter
    * updated copyright to 2000

  Revision 1.2  1999/11/09 22:57:09  peter
    * compiles again both i386,alpha both with optimizer

  Revision 1.1  1999/08/18 14:32:26  jonas
    + compilable!
    + dataflow analyzer finished
    + start of CSE units
    + aoptbase which contains a base object for all optimizer objects
    * some constants and type definitions moved around to avoid circular
      dependencies
    * moved some methods from base objects to specialized objects because
      they're not used anywhere else
