 $Log$
 Revision 1.5  1999-08-18 14:32:24  jonas
   + compilable!
   + dataflow analyzer finished
   + start of CSE units
   + aoptbase which contains a base object for all optimizer objects
   * some constants and type definitions moved around to avoid circular
     dependencies
   * moved some methods from base objects to specialized objects because
     they're not used anywhere else

 Revision 1.4  1999/08/11 14:23:39  jonas
   * some fixes to RegReadByInstr

 Revision 1.3  1999/08/10 12:40:20  jonas
   + implemented RegReadByInstr

 Revision 1.1  1999/08/08 13:24:50  jonas
   + added copyright header/GNU license info
   * made the assembler optimizer almost completely OOP
   * some code style clean up and extra comments
   * moved from the new/aopt to the /new and /new/i386 dirs
