  Revision 1.3  2003-11-02 14:30:03  florian
    * fixed ARM for new reg. allocation scheme

  Revision 1.2  2003/09/11 11:55:00  florian
    * improved arm code generation
    * move some protected and private field around
    * the temp. register for register parameters/arguments are now released
      before the move to the parameter register is done. This improves
      the code in a lot of cases.

  Revision 1.1  2003/08/27 00:27:56  florian
    + same procedure as very day: today's work on arm
