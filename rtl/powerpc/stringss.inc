  $Log$
  Revision 1.4  2001-09-27 15:30:29  jonas
    * conversion to compilerproc and to structure used by i386 rtl
    * some bugfixes
    * powerpc.inc is almost complete (only fillchar/word/dword, get_frame etc
      and the class helpers are still needed
    - removed unnecessary register saving in set.inc (thanks to compilerproc)
    * use registers reserved for parameters as much as possible instead of
      those reserved for local vars (since those have to be saved by the
      called anyway, while the ones for local vars have to be saved by the
      callee)

  Revision 1.3  2001/07/07 12:46:12  jonas
    * some small bugfixes and cache optimizations

  Revision 1.2  2001/02/11 12:15:03  jonas
    * some small optimizations and bugfixes

  Revision 1.1  2001/02/10 16:10:32  jonas
    * initial implementation: everything implemented, nothing tested
