FreeBSD status and notes. (kept on CVS because I work on several places)

At the moment that you are reading this, FPC for FreeBSD is still a dream.
We are currently working actively on FreeBSD support.



NI=not implemented yet
req=required for compiler
noreq? = probably not required, but not checked.

syscall   status        comment

------------------------------------------------------------------------         

Readdir	 implemented 
	   from 
          scratch, 
          untested.   

Clone()	 NI noreq	Looks awfully complicated. Should be based on RFork.

sysinfo  NI noreq       Not supported under BSD, not even by emulator
uname    NI noreq       "        "       "    "   "   "    "   "
			(procedure based on this call are also commented
		          (get* procs))

signal   NI  noreq?      A *lot* of emulation code.
alarm    NI  noreq?      Could be possible to port.
pause 	 NI  noreq?	 Also possible I think. Uses process information	
			 in linux-emu, that is why I didn't port directly.

IOPERM   NI  noreq?      Concept doesn't exist.
