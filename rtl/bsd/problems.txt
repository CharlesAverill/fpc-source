FreeBSD status and notes. (kept on CVS because I work on several places)

NI=not implemented yet
req=required for compiler
noreq? = probably not required, but not checked.

syscall   status        comment

------------------------------------------------------------------------         

Readdir	 NI req	        Three pages code in the linux emulator which uses calls
		 	we probably can't access :-) GetDents uses the
		 	same calls tho.

Clone()	 NI noreq	Looks awfully complicated. Should be based on RFork.

Select   NI noreq?      See maillist. Doesn't seem to comply to manpage.

sysinfo  NI noreq       Not supported under BSD, not even by emulator
uname    NI noreq       "        "       "    "   "   "    "   "
			(procedure based on this call are also commented
		          (get* procs))

signal   NI  noreq?      A *lot* of emulation code.
alarm    NI  noreq?      Could be possible to port.
