Wellcome to the MacOS port of FreePascal (FPC)
==============================================

It is considered under construction, at the moment.


Please note that compiling must be done on a platform
supported by FPC, e g a PC. Then the generated assemble files
is to be transfered to a Macintosh with MPW installed.


For compiling with FPC, use it as for other operating systems 
and add these options:

-Tmacos # target macos
-dpowerpc
-al	# dont delete asm output
-s	# dont generate executable



Use MPW to assemble and link the output from FreePascal

For PPCAsm, use options:

-case on

For PPCLink, use options

-dead on
-tocdataref off
-m program_init
