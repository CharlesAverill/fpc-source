This is the Run-Time Library (RTL) tree for Free Pascal.

In order to use the DJGPP make under dos 
all / are converted into \ in the RTL,
this means that you cannot use make for builing the RTL
from and older version of the RTL (that doesnot have this feature).
  To compile this version under DOS use newrtl.bat or newrtl1.bat.
 
To recompile the RTL, edit the main makefile. The makefiles NEED a GNU make
compatible make, they need unix-like 'rm' and 'mv' commands. You can find
these in the gnuutils package on the ftp site.

You must set:
The compiler to use
  - If you specify a path, set an ABSOLUTE path !!
The directory where to install the libraries. 
  - Under DOS, this directory MUST exist.
  - Subdirectories of this directory will be created for each OS
    OS dependent files will be installed there.
The OS you are compiling under
  - dos, go32v2, linux, os2
  - Under linux, you must specify the version of the compiler.
Do you want debugging information included in the RTL.
 
Optionally, you can set:
- Specify if you want the output of the compiler to be redirected to a file.
- Specify which file to use 
- additional options to give to the compiler
- Specify which error-definitions file you want to use 
- The program used to make directories
- The program used to install the files in their directories.

You can also set these settings in the makefiles in the different target 
directories. The options set there will be overridden if you do a make from
the main makefile.

The main makefile understands the following targets :
- all      (compiles RTL for all target OSes)
- native   (compiles RTL for the system you're working on)
- rtlgo32v1, rtllinux, rtlgo32v2, rtlos2 (compiles RTL for specific OS)

- clean    (cleans all directories )
- native_clean (cleans native directory only)
- diffs     ( to create diffs files to a relase version if you have
	      made improvements so you can send them back to the developpers )
	    ( this need a release RTL tree and to
	      set REFPATH to the directory )	
- diffclean ( to remove all diff files, usefull if you change REFPATH)
- install      (does install for all target OSes)
- native_install (does install for the system you're working on)

- libs              (makes libraries from ALL the rtl units)
- nativelibs        (makes libraries for the system you're working on)
- libinstall        (makes and installs libraries for all the OSes)
- native_libinstall (makes and installs libraries for the system 
                     you're working on)

- utils         (makes utilities in the utils subdirectory)
- utils_install (makes and installs utilities in the utils subdirectory)

Enjoy!
