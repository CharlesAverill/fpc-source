 Linux system calls take arguments as follows :

   i386    m68k    ppc
   %eax    %d0     r0      System call number
   %ebx    %d1     r3      first argument
   %ecx    %d2     r4      second argument
   %edx    %d3     r5      third argumens
   %esi    %d3     r6      fourth argument
   %edi    %d4     r7      fifth argument

  That is why we define a special type, with only these arguments
  To make it processor independent, we don't give any system dependent
  names, but the rather abstract reg1,reg2 etc;
