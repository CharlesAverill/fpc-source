    Implementation of the baseunix unit for *BSD^H^H^Hlinux. In practice only
    includes other files, or specifies libc bindings.

    The conditional uselibc can be used to switch from libc to syscall
    usage for basic primitives, but it is best to use unit POSIX if
    possible. Note that the system unit must also be compiled using uselibc.
